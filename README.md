## Description

In the digital age, where the internet is our go-to for almost everything, ease and accessibility aren’t just luxuries—they’re essentials. PopApp redefines how you interact with your favorite online spaces, making every click more meaningful by eliminating friction from your workflow. With a single keyboard shortcut, PopApp brings up to four of your essential websites right where you need them—no more tab-juggling or context-switching.
